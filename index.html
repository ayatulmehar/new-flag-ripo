    <h3 style="text-align: center;">Our National Flag</h3>
    <p> National flag is a powerful symbol that embodies the independence and sovereignty of a country. Bangladesh, as an independent nation, has its own national flag. It is rectangular in shape, with a length-to-width ratio of 10:6. The flag features a prominent red circle at its center.

        The color green on our flag represents youthfulness, while the color red symbolizes the rising sun. These colors honor the supreme sacrifices made by our freedom fighters and language heroes. Every day, our national flag proudly flies atop important government buildings and educational institutions. During times of mourning, it is respectfully flown at half-mast.
        
        As a citizen, I take great pride in our national flag because it serves as a constant reminder of our hard-fought freedom. On December 16, 1971, Bangladesh gained independence from Pakistan, and it is our responsibility to uphold the honor of our flag by fulfilling our national duties. We must be ready to make sacrifices for our country and safeguard our sovereignty.
        
        Let us always cherish and respect our national flag as a symbol of our freedom and the courage of our heroes. Together, we can build a stronger and more prosperous nation.</p>
